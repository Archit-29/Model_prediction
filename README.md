# Regression Model Evaluation with Multiple Algorithms

This project demonstrates the implementation of multiple regression models to predict a target variable using a dataset uploaded through Google Colab. The models are evaluated based on their performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared (R²), and the results are visualized using scatter plots.

## Overview

This script loads a dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, and evaluates the performance of several regression models:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- K-Nearest Neighbors

The code outputs evaluation metrics for each model and generates scatter plots comparing actual and predicted values.

## Features

- Supports uploading datasets directly in Google Colab.
- Implements and evaluates multiple regression algorithms.
- Computes metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared (R²).
- Visualizes actual vs. predicted values for each model.
